Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
[The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. We see that the cat's shadow progressing into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGongall is revealed.]

McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
McGonagall: And the boy?
Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.
McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Dumbledore: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid, takes off his goggles.]

Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]
